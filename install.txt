When you download this app, you must do the following to finish the installation:

1) Build the vendor directory
In the Laravel app directory ("list" in this case), run the command "composer install".



2) Make sure Apache has write access to the "storage" and "bootstrap/cache" directories.
If you're installing on Ubuntu, you can probably just make sure the "www-data" user or group has write access.

*** You probably also want to run a command like "sudo chmod -R g+w storage/" so that Apache has the correct access. While setting up and running migrations on my stage computer, I ran into errors about access problems with a log file under storage/ until I ran that command. ***



3) Set up the ".env" file in the app directory.
You can probably just copy and modify the automatically included example ".env.example" file, which may be hidden.
**Check you don't already have a ".env" file before you copy the example.**



4) Generate an App Key.
In the application directory (in this case "list"), run the command "php artisan key:generate" to generate the random app key.



5) Make sure the app is externally accessible through Apache.

**
**Make sure Apache points to the "public" folder, not the app folder.**
**

**You'll probably have to restart Apache after making changes to the config files.**

You might have to add something like below to "/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf" (or you can configure the "public" folder to be the document root for all of Apache)

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName list.example.com
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/example/public"
    <Directory "/var/www/html/example/public">
        AllowOverride All
     </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
